```
As a user,
So that I can access my favourite web pages
I want to see a list of my bookmarks

As a user,
So that I can go back to a webpage later
I want to save it in my bookmarks

As a user,
So that I can remove webpages I no longer need,
I want to delete bookmarks from the list

As a user,
So that I can modify my content,
I want to amend an existing bookmark.

As a user,
So that I can remember the details of a page
I want to tag my bookmarks into categories

As a user,
So that I can only see the bookmarks Iâ€™m interested in,
I want to filter bookmarks by their tags

As a user,
So that I can manage my own bookmarks,
I want to register and sign into my account.
